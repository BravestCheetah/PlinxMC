# Building the launcher
*my exe not good enough? Then do it yourself* >:(

### Widows
Building for widows is the easiest operating system to buid for, ive already done it for you! The only thing you have to do, is clone the repo,
or download the source zip in the [latest release](https://github.com/BravestCheetah/PlinxMC/releases/latest)

When you have the code, youll have to have python 3 installed as well as PyInstaller (pip install PyInstaller). Then you just have to run build.py by
just double clicking on it or executing it through the terminal (py/python/python3 build.py)

If you wanna build it yourself (without build.py) youll have to use PyInstaller directly, if you chose to build it that way you have to take this into account:
all assets in the /assets folder have to be included in the exe so they can be accessed, the icon for the launcher is assets/exeicon.ico

### Linux
*not yet, i dont use arch (btw)*

### mac
*why pay so much for a laptop?*
